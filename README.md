### Turn your keyboard into an electronic drum kit that also triggers some tasty visuals.

This is an application that turns your keyboard into an electronic drum kit controller. Key strokes trigger a variety of drum sounds that can be combined to make a beat. The ear-tickling sounds are accompanied by colorful visuals making the overall experience a pleasure for the senses. The user is guided through some "getting started" prompts when the page first loads.

User can:

* Press keys to trigger a sound and a colorful visual
* Press multiple keys together rhythmically to create a drum beat
* Receive introduction prompts on how to get started with the application

Tech Highlights:

* Used **promises** to handle the asynchronous interaction that the user has with the introduction prompts
* Used canvas JS library **Paper.js** to create the colorful animations
* Used audio JS library **Howler.js** to load, cache, and play the drum sounds
